# TennisChairUmpireAppUI
This application is designed for use by a head tennis umpire during a tennis match, providing comprehensive match management capabilities. 
The visual aspect of the application was constructed using the JavaFX framework, 
while the database functionality was implemented through the use of JBDC Driver (SQLITE).
